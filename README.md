<h2> Project 1 : Decision Tree </h2>
    <p>
        This algorithm takes in input data with binary class labels, and processes the data in order to train a decision tree to determine if a patient needs corrective lenses with their given condition. The algorithm is a decision tree with entropy as its way of classifying which attribute to select an attribute for any given level of the tree. at the end a visual representation of the graph is displayed.
