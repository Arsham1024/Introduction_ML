# Decision Tree
##### This algorithm was developed for the first assignment of Introduction to Machine Learning class
---
### Description:
###### This algorithm takes in input data with binary class labels, and processes the data in order to train a decision tree 
to determine if a patient needs corrective lenses with their given condition. The algorithm is a decision tree with entropy as its
way of classifying which attribute to select an attribute for any given level of the tree. at the end a visual representation of the
graph is displayed.

### Data Set:
###### as mentioned the data set consists of conditions for each patient. 
The attributes are:
* Age
* Spectacle Prescription
* Astigmatism
* Tear Production Rate

the class attribute is Recommended Lenses and it is a binary class.
